# test-site

This repo simply automates application of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to stuff in driconnect/content, and propagates rendered results to a [live website](https://driconnect.sharcnet.ca) 

You can use git commands or the git.computecanada.ca site to change or add content.

This site will be moved to github for greater accessibility, and hopefully will eventually
appear as driconnect.alliancecan.ca.
