This year's DRI Connect has now concluded. Thank you to all who joined us for
being part of the amazing experience! This year's conference set a new
DRI Connect record for number of attendees.

If you missed this year's conference or if you weren't able to attend all of the
sessions you had hoped to, we now have a selection of session recordings
available on the Alliance's [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2jE_DQZemnXBYSEzzxxm86dbgVCXalPi)
for you to enjoy!
