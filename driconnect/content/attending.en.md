DRI Connect Conference | May 27-28, 2024  
Halifax Convention Centre  
Halifax, NS  

We look forward to welcoming you to the 2024 DRI Connect conference, whether you are joining us in-person or online!

## Program

We are excited to feature an exceptional lineup of presenters covering a wide range of topics. You can find the
up-to-date [program details](/program). **Please note all times are in Atlantic time.**

You might have noticed we are offering 3 parallel streams at different points throughout Day 1 and Day 2.

Stream 1       Plenary/Main Room (Attendees do not need to move around)  
Stream 2       Room 102 on the Convention Hall Level  
Stream 3       Room 103 on the Convention Hall Level  

We encourage you to pre-select the sessions you wish to attend and move quickly to the designated breakout room or Zoom
link to ensure programming proceeds smoothly.
