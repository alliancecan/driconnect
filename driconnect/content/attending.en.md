We look forward to welcoming you to the 2024 DRI Connect conference, whether you are joining us in-person or online!

## Program

We are excited to feature an exceptional lineup of presenters covering a wide range of topics. You can find the

You might have noticed we are offering 3 parallel streams at different points throughout Day 1 and Day 2.

Stream 1       Plenary/Main Room (Attendees do not need to move around)  
Stream 2       Room 102 on the Convention Hall Level

We encourage you to pre-select the sessions you wish to attend and move quickly to the designated breakout room or Zoom
link to ensure programming proceeds smoothly.

## Zoom and Slack Details

We will be using Zoom and Slack during the conference. Details on how to access these resources will be sent to
registrants by way of a "Know Before You Go" email in the days prior to the start of the event.

## Meals

DRI Connect will provide attendees with meals on both days of the conference. Breakfast will be served each day from
8:00 AM to 9:00 AM and lunch from 12:30PM- 1:30PM in Convention Hall C5.

Attendees who have specified dietary requirements will be accommodated and asked to make themselves known to the Banquet
Staff to ensure specially prepared meals are delivered to them. Note that all foods will be appropriately labeled for
easy identification.
