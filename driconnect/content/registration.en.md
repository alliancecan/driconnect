<strong>Registration is now open for DRI Connect 2025!</strong>


Register today to secure your place at this year's event at Concordia University in Montreal on May 27-28, 2025.

<strong> Important to note </strong>

While this is an in-person event, we’re committed to making the content accessible to everyone. Where permitted by presenters, session recordings will be available. We will also provide remote access to materials and other accessibility supports based upon the accessibility needs of participants as we develop the program and plan the event.  

Please ensure at registration that you note any accessibility requirements before the registration cut-off date so we may ensure any dietary, audio-visual, or other accessibility needs are accounted for. 

 

Don't miss this opportunity to connect with colleagues and leaders in digital research infrastructure. Register today! 

Registration will remain open until May 20, 2025, or until all spaces are filled, whichever comes first. 

For registration support, contact us at alliance@coherent-solutions.ca
