See the [Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

We encourage constructive discussions during sessions, but we ask you to:
* Be as concise as possible when asking a question with some context
* Let others ask questions

For longer talks, there are breaks between sessions,
breakout rooms and social activities.

Thank you for your collaboration.
