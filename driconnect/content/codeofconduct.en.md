_Adapted from code4libâ€™s Code of Conduct: <http://bit.ly/coc4lib>_

Events are a wonderful opportunity to network, learn, and exchange ideas. By following these guidelines, we can all
contribute to creating a positive and respectful environment where everyone can learn and connect effectively. Thank you
for your cooperation and enjoy DRI Connect!

- Be respectful: Discriminatory language is not appropriate in any venue or platform. The Alliance does not tolerate
  harassment in any form. Harassment is understood as any behaviour that threatens another person or group or produces
  an unsafe environment.

- Be open-minded: Try to keep an open mind and be receptive to new ideas and perspectives. Whenever possible, give
  people the benefit of the doubt! We are all here to learn, and this event is a great opportunity to broaden your
  understanding of different topics.

## Letâ€™s Keep Everyone Healthy

You can ensure the comfort of those around you by:

- Regular handwashing and/or using hand sanitizer ðŸ§¼ ðŸ§´

- Wearing adequate footwear at all times ðŸ‘Ÿ ðŸ‘ž ðŸ‘ 

- Covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing ðŸ™Š ðŸ¤§

- Respecting peopleâ€™s choice to mask ðŸ˜· (Masks will be offered at the registration desk for those who wish to wear
  one.)

## No Scents Makes Good Sense

Some people have sensitivities to various chemical-based or scented products. We ask for everyone's cooperation in our
efforts to accommodate their health concerns. Scented products such as hairspray, perfume, cologne/aftershave and
heavily-scented deodorant can trigger reactions such as respiratory distress and headaches to folks with sensitivities.
DRI Connect in-person participants are asked to please not use chemical-based or scented products while sharing common
spaces.

## Photo Guidelines

Please ask for a participant's permission before taking a photo/video, and confirm before you post to social media.

## Conflict Resolution

If you witness or experience any issues while participating in DRI Connect, and feel comfortable speaking with the other
participant, please inform them that they have affected you negatively. Their behaviour may not be intentional and you
may be able to resolve things by having a discussion.

We understand that there are many reasons why a participant might not feel comfortable addressing things directly. In
this case, you might need someone to step in and help. If you are attending in person, you can find a Community Support
Volunteer. These people will be identified at the conference and can also be reached by email. If you are attending
online, you can privately message the Moderator. Moderators may not be Community Support Volunteers, but they know how
to direct you to them.

All conversations will be kept private and confidential.
