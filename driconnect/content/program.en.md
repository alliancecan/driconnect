# Towards Integrated Solutions for Digital Research 
The theme of the conference “Towards Integrated Solutions for Digital Research” was born out of a desire to craft a program that keeps collaboration at its core and offers content that highlights innovative approaches and solutions to breaking down silos and promoting synergy. Ultimately, our hope is that DRI Connect will contribute to a shared vision that leverages the full potential of digital research infrastructure (DRI) in Canada.

Watch this space for more program updates! The finalized program will be published in April. 

# DRI Connect Dinner and ACENET Celebration
