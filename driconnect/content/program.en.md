          <summary class="h6">Keynote - AI’s role in digital research, ethical considerations in AI adoption, or data-driven decision-making in research environments
          </summary>
          <p>
            Dr. Sidney Shapiro, Business Analytics Professor and AI Researcher at the University of Lethbridge
          </p>
          <p>
          Artificial intelligence (and more recently, Generative AI) is rapidly transforming research across disciplines in Canada—shaping how studies are designed, how data is analyzed, and how knowledge is produced. This evolution is bringing about fundamental changes to research workflows, methods, and infrastructure. At the same time, it raises critical questions about how public research institutions can engage with AI meaningfully and sustainably, particularly in the context of growing disparities in digital research capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
          This keynote will examine the current and emerging role of AI in Canadian research, with a focus on infrastructure challenges and strategic considerations. While private industry has advanced rapidly in developing generative AI technologies using vast computational resources, academic institutions face structural limitations that affect their ability to keep pace. Limited access to high-performance computing, specialized engineering expertise, and integrated systems continues to restrict what public institutions can build, implement, or study. As generative AI becomes both a method for research and a subject of research itself, the question becomes: what infrastructure and strategy are needed to support this work in the academic context?
         </p>
         <p>
         The talk will highlight how AI is being used as a research tool to support discovery, enhance analysis, and enable new forms of scholarly communication. It will also address the increasing significance of generative AI as an object of research, with active inquiry taking place across domains such as ethics, linguistics, education, and computational science. This dual role presents a set of unique challenges for research planning, funding, and institutional coordination.
         </p>
         <p>
         Key issues to be addressed include uneven access to advanced computing infrastructure, gaps in workforce readiness, and the growing need for national coordination around shared resources such as compute, data, and software. The session will also explore how institutional and policy frameworks can support responsible AI adoption, with attention to governance, training, and ethical oversight. The keynote will conclude by outlining strategic priorities for building sustainable AI capacity in Canada's research ecosystem. These priorities extend beyond technical infrastructure to include talent development, interdisciplinary collaboration, and investment models that reflect both the promise and the complexity of AI in research.

            Over the past decade, training has become an increasingly important part of our mission, with demand continuing to grow. To enhance our offerings and better leverage the data we collect, we launched a pilot project aimed at streamlining and standardizing training data collection and reporting processes. Since we don’t yet have full confidence in which metrics will best meet the Alliance’s national reporting needs, this project also includes a collaborative component to align our approach with broader Federation expectations.

              Understanding the researchers’ needs is critical to providing the infrastructure that enable them to maximize their contributions to their respective research areas. When researchers use DRAC resources they leave traces about their needs and successes. This starts with their user and group account details but extends out into their job records and research outputs. What can we tell about the needs and successes of our researchers by aggregating data from the various information sources that we currently have (e.g. user profiles, allocations, job records, publications, support tickets, etc) and what else could we learn by implementing new data collections that would give us more fine grained access to other key properties of research production (e.g. storage use, software utilization, job performance metrics, training registrations and outcomes, etc).

              Data Management Plans (DMPs) – they seem simple, but are they? How can we navigate the complexities of data security? How can we design a one-size-fits-all template for diverse research needs while ensuring requirements are met? In today's digital age, the requirements for DMPs have evolved, with a heightened focus on cybersecurity, privacy, and compliance. In this lightning talk, we will present a summary of our updates to modernize the UBC DMP template with emphasize data security in mind, as well as meeting the increasing demands of funding agencies and regulatory bodies.

          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding file formats is one of the first steps in determining preservation capabilities and risk to long-term access. However, digital preservation identification tools fail to identify many file formats associated with research data creating a barrier to an important initial step in the preservation process. This presentation will describe the ongoing work undertaken by the digital preservation team to develop file format signatures to help identify file formats found in the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR). It also seeks to solicit feedback from the broader DRI community on other possible approaches to file format identification work.

          High-throughput technologies are transforming biomedical research by enabling the detailed characterization of individual genomes and cellular molecular processes at unprecedented resolution. When paired with advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, these technologies hold immense promise for driving innovation in health sciences and improving healthcare outcomes. However, realizing this potential requires overcoming significant challenges in data management, software infrastructure, and computational resources. Here, I will present key initiatives addressing some of these challenges. The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)—a not-for-profit alliance of over 500 organizations—is developing technical standards, policy frameworks, and tools to promote the responsible, voluntary, and secure use of genomic and related health data worldwide. I will also present SecureData4Health, a secure cloud-based infrastructure designed to support the analysis and sharing of genomic and health data. It builds on existing capabilities in Ontario through HPC4Health and adds a new compute node in Québec to enhance national capacity. Finally, I will introduce the Pan-Canadian Genome Library (PCGL), a landmark initiative unifying Canada’s human genome sequencing effort. PCGL establishes a centralized, federated data management system aligned with international standards and respectful of jurisdictional and cultural constraints around human genetic data. It supports both retrospective and new projects, ensuring long-term archival, accessibility, and integration of genomic, clinical, and phenotypic data. Together, these efforts lay the foundation for a robust, secure, and collaborative ecosystem that will accelerate genomic research and improve health outcomes across Canada and beyond.

Codenamed S4H, this environment is already available to groups at the University of Toronto as a pilot project. S4H aims to meet researchers’ needs for hosting and working with sensitive data, which SciNet’s main cluster, Niagara, does not accommodate. We’ll explain how S4H data are encrypted at rest and access is hardened, talk about the difficulties of providing isolation for different research groups on a shared system, and explore the different components that make it possible, such as key management and containerization mechanisms.  We will also focus on our adoption of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) framework, describing our journey deciphering the complexities of the NIST 800-171 control set, crafting Plans of Action and Milestones for compliance gaps, and internal and external assessments to verify compliance.

            <p>
              The future of Canada’s digital research in health and genomics is relying on robust privacy and security safeguards. Data security has always been a concern for human genomics research, and since its progressive but intensive usage of the Canadian DRI infrastructure, different levels of pressure have been put on us, Alliance members, to make our infrastructure secure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Achieving robust security for human health projects is no longer a distant goal. New requirements, like the recent update to the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy, have made it a priority for research groups previously less concerned with this aspect. The old approach of neglecting security demands is not viable for many new research projects.
             </p>
             <p>
              SD4H is based on an OpenStack cloud infrastructure managed jointly by McGill's Canadian Center for Computational Genomics (C3G) and Calcul Québec. Advanced Research Computing, Research Data Management, and Research Software services are developed and deployed on this infrastructure, providing privacy and security for its users.

            <p>
              2025 is the international year for quantum science and technology, marking 100 years since the first official publication of quantum mechanics. At Calcul Québec we are celebrating with the launch of our quantum services on MonarQ, our 24 qubit quantum computer. But what is quantum computing, and is it really that different from managing the classical systems, software and data that we know and love? What happens if classical and quantum systems are connected together? We will be discussing these questions while sharing our extraordinary journey of launching quantum computing services at Calcul Québec, and the amazing team that has made it possible. After all, successfully facilitating the research of tomorrow is not just about the latest technology, it's about the people that make it happen.

          <p>
            First, we will explain the context in which OSSecMon was created (We had noticed deficiencies at certain levels concerning, among other things, basic security principles, e.g., non-repudiation, and this led us to develop a solution that did not yet exist). Afterwards, we will briefly overview the main technology used by the program (eBPF) and explain how we use it in ossecmon, followed by a brief overview of complementary tools used such as inotify, yara, and openscap. We will conclude by explaining how OSSecMon can be used to comply with certain standards such as NIST, ISO, etc. We will probably run out of time, but everything will be followed by a question period.

          <p>
            In this talk, we will introduce Open OnDemand, a web-based interface designed to provide easy access to High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources. Terminal-based interfaces can be challenging for new users with limited experience, resulting in a steep learning curve. Open OnDemand aims to make HPC more accessible by offering an intuitive graphical interface that simplifies the process of submitting, monitoring and managing jobs. We will explore the key features of Open OnDemand, including web-based access, job management, file management and support for interactive applications like Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, and VS Code. Additionally, we will demonstrate the SciNet and Grex Open OnDemand portal and discuss their deployment and use cases.
